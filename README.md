# NYHack

This project streams real-time NYC traffic data on the map. This is to inform people of which areas are crowded so that users can make informed decisions about where to travel in the city. 
NYC traffic information was scrapped from http://207.251.86.229/nyc-links-cams/LinkSpeedQuery.txt
Streaming and analytics done using spark
Visualizations in osmnx and folium
